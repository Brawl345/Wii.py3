Wii.py3 (WIP)
=======
This is a work-in-progress port of the Wii library [Wii.py](https://github.com/grp/Wii.py) to Python 3(.6).
The end goal is to improve the original code, make a few changes to ensure correct behaviour and add new classes and functions for manipulating more Wii data.

All changes are listed in the CHANGES.md file.
